 Bad trips like, yeah Nazareth, I'm fucked up, homie you fucked up

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Uh, and when I wake up I recognize you looking at me for the pay cut

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Why Mack 11 even rule with the face down?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Schemin', now let me tell you about my life

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Painkillers only put me in a twilight

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like, Lord knows

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Reaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 No preliminary hearings on my record

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I'm a motherfucking gangsta in silence for the record, uh

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Tell the world I know it's too late

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Boys and girls I think I've gone crazy

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Trying to decide my prices all day

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Won't you please believe when I say

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Wouldn't you know, we been hurt, been down before

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Nigga, when our pride was low

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Looking at the world like, where do we go?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Nigga, and we hate pro-poor

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 When the killers dead and the street was sure

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Nigga, I met the preacher's door

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 My knees getting weak and my gun might blow

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But we gon' be alright

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Nigga, we gon' be alright

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Nigga, we gon' be alright

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 We gon' be alright

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Do you hear me? Do you feel me?

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 We gon' be alright

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Nigga, we gon' be alright

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Huh? We gon' be alright

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Nigga, we gon' be alright

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Do you hear me? Do you feel me?

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 We gon' be alright

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 What you want? You a house? You a car?

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 You got the acres and the mule, a piano, a guitar?

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Motherfucker, you can live at the mall

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I can see the evil, I can tell it

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I know it's illegal, I don't think about it

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 I deposit every other zero

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Thinking of my partner, put the candy painting on a Rico

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Big enough to feed you, everyday my logic

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Get another dollar just to keep you in the presence of your Chico

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Ah!

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I don't talk about it, be about it

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Everyday I sequel, if I got it, then you know you got it

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Heaven, I can reach you

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Big back and chat, I trap the bag for y'all

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I rap, I black on track, so rest assured

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 My rights, my wrongs, I write 'til I'm right with God

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 When you know, we been hurt, been down before

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Nigga, when our pride was low

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Looking at the world like, "Where do we go?"

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Nigga, and we hate po' po'

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 One to kill is dead in the street for sure

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 My knees getting weak and my gun might blow

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 But we gon' be alright

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Nigga, we gon' be alright

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Nigga, we gon' be alright

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 We gon' be alright

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Nigga, we gon' be alright

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Do you hear me? Do you feel me? We gon' be alright

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Nigga, we gon' be alright

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Huh? We gon' be alright

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Nigga, we gon' be alright

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Do you hear me? Do you feel me? We gon' be alright

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 I keep my head up, my eyebrows smile

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I pray you won't deny

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Love me is complicated

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Too afraid of life changes

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I'm alright in your favor

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Dark nights and my prayers
